## Remotely access other computer's terminal via TCP connection

Installation:
  
  Clone this repository into a folder.
  Good practice is to add the folder to your PATH:
    
      $ export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/repo/bin"
      
Usage:
  
  Just cd into /path/to/repo/bin and type
  
      $ ./rshell

  In some systems, you may need to get permission to execute

      $ sudo chmod +x rshell
      
  The CLI itself provides a full guide for rShell usage
